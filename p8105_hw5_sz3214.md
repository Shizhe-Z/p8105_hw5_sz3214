## Problem 1

**function**

``` r
birthday = function(n) {
  birthdays = sample(1:365, n, replace = TRUE) 
  duplication = any(duplicated(birthdays))  
  return(duplication)
}
```

**run function on different group sizes**

``` r
set.seed(42)  
n_simulation = 10000  
size = 2:50  
result = numeric(length(size))

for (i in seq_along(size)) {
  n = size[i]
  duplicate = replicate(n_simulation, birthday(n))  
  result[i] = mean(duplicate)  
}

data = data.frame(group_size = size, probability = result)
```

**draw the plot**

``` r
ggplot(data, aes(x = group_size, y = probability)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Probability of Shared Birthday in a Group",
       x = "Group Size",
       y = "Probability of Shared Birthday") +
  theme_minimal()
```

As the group size increases, the probability that at least two people in
the group share a birthday rises quickly.
